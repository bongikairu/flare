## So, what's this page?

This page is a code repository of the engine. The [part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQP87ZzcaP0) where the actual model is rendered onto the screen. Just that. It's written in C++ and compiled into Asm.js compatible code by [Emscripten](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten). You're free to study this code.
